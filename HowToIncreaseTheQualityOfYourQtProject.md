How to increase the quality of your Qt Project!
===============================================

In this article I wanna describe how to start a new successful Qt Project. The goal should be to start C++ projects nowadays similar like in some other fields (Test-Driven, with Continious Integration, Code Quality Metrics etc.)

The most important part is Test-Driven-Development, the team should learn how to create code and features ONLY with the needed tests. I know that's really hard at the beginning. The easiest way for me at the beginning was to write the test code after I wrote the functionality, also if the Test-first approach should be your target.
